## üéØ Target Users

## ‚ùå Problem Statement
Chit funds and microfinance organizations often face challenges due to manual processes:
- Contributions are tracked in registers or spreadsheets, leading to errors.  
- Payment reminders are delayed or missed, causing defaults.  
- Auctions are conducted offline, limiting transparency and slowing decision-making.  
- Managers lack dashboards for tracking collections, payouts, and overdue payments.  

These inefficiencies reduce trust, delay collections, and limit scalability.

- Providing dashboards for collections, defaults, auctions, and fund performance.  
- Offering role-based access for managers, agents, and members.
