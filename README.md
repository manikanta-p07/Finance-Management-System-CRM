Project Title: Finance Management System – Salesforce CRM 
Target Users: Fund Managers, Finance Agents, Members (Customers), and Regulators 
Problem Statement 
Chit funds and microfinance organizations often face challenges due to manual processes: 
• Contributions are tracked in registers or spreadsheets, leading to errors. 
• Payment reminders are delayed or missed, causing defaults. 
• Auctions are conducted offline, limiting transparency and slowing decision-making. 
• Managers lack dashboards for tracking collections, payouts, and overdue payments. 
These inefficiencies reduce trust, delay collections, and limit scalability. 
Proposed Solution: Salesforce-Based Finance Management System 
A Salesforce-based Finance Management System addresses these issues by: 
• Centralizing all member, contribution, and auction records. 
• Automating SMS/Email reminders for upcoming payments and auctions. 
• Providing dashboards for collections, defaults, auctions, and fund performance. 
• Offering role-based access for managers, agents, and members. 
• Improving transparency and compliance with accurate digital records. 
Phase 1: Problem Understanding & Industry Analysis 
Requirement Gathering 
• Digitalize member profiles, contributions, and auctions in Salesforce. 
• Automate reminders and notifications for payments and auctions. 
• Provide dashboards and reports for fund managers. 
• Enable agents to quickly record contributions and missed payments. 
• Ensure scalability and compliance with chit fund regulations. 
Stakeholder Analysis 
Primary Stakeholders (Direct Users): 
• Fund Managers (Admin): Need full visibility of collections, auctions, and defaults. 
• Finance Agents (Users): Require tools to record contributions and follow up on 
missed payments. 
• Members (Customers): Expect timely reminders, confirmations, and transparency in 
auctions. 
• Regulators (Indirect Stakeholders): Require accurate digital records for auditing 
and compliance. 
Business Process Mapping 
Current Process: 
• Contributions recorded manually in books or spreadsheets. 
• Reminders sent via phone calls or manual SMS. 
• Auctions conducted offline with limited transparency. 
• Reports generated monthly, often delayed and error-prone. 
Proposed Salesforce Process: 
• Member contributions recorded directly as Salesforce records. 
• Automated SMS/Email reminders triggered for due payments. 
• Auctions managed digitally with real-time notifications and updates. 
• Dashboards generated automatically for collections, auctions, and overdue accounts.

3. Auction Management 
o Schedule auctions and notify eligible members. 
o Track winner details and disbursed amounts.

5. Reporting & Dashboards 
o Monitor total contributions, overdue payments, and auctions.

o Provide compliance-ready audit reports. 
AppExchange Exploration 
• Loan Management Apps – Useful for tracking repayment cycles and overdue 
collections. 
• Payment Processing Apps – Enable digital payment tracking (UPI, Bank Transfer, 
Cards). 
• Notification Apps (SMS/Email Integrations) – Automate member communication. 
• Financial Dashboards – Prebuilt templates to visualize fund performance and 
collections. 
This confirms the project is unique, addressing a gap in the market with chit fund–specific 
automation.
